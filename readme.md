# GraphQL

## Advantages

Helps to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching
Very good for bringing out stuff only that we need

## Steps

    npm init -y

<br/>
    
    npm install apollo-server graphql

<br/>

by using the apollo-server we will be working  on the graphql part
here we had to bring in the **typeDefs** & **resolvers** for the configuration of the apollo-server

then in the localhost we can see the apollo server running live and we will be making the simple **Scalar Typed [String, Int, Boolean, Float, ID!]** data acquisitions
